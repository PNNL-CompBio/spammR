This branch contains a few old scripts that are not part of spammR. These scripts were written for previous specific analyses from previous projects and are not directly applicable here. 
Saved this as a branch in case any of these unused scripts may be needed in the future. 
The Master branch has all the scripts in spammR, up-to-date.
