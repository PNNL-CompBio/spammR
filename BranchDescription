This branch contains a few old scripts that are not applicable and are not part of spammR. These scripts were written for previous specific analyses from previous projects and are not applicable here. 
Saved this as a branch in case any of these unused scripts may be needed in the future. 
The Master branch has all the scripts in spammR, up-to-date.
